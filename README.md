## Overview

This app allows users to send and receive text and photos in realtime across platforms.

## Setup

Setup requires creating a Firebase project. See https://firebase.google.com/ for more information.
User will have to open up his own account and connect it to the app by replacing the google-services.json file. Then enable authentication and connect the firebase database to the app ( customise the name of firebase database directory - "chat" and "message" used in the app ) and you are goos to go.

Feel free to report an issue and work on it.
